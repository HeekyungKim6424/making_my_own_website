<h2>About me </h2>
<p>
Hello, I am the person who made this homepage.<br>
Currently, I am majoring in It at Sookmyung Women's University in Korea in 2021.<br>
This page has the concept of a site created by Hogwarts students for Muggle Exploration class.<br>
If you have any other ideas, we would appreciate it if you could send us your comments via email below.<br>
And if Hogwarts students find this page, if you send me the information to modify,<br>
I will correct it as soon as I check the mail.<br>
Any kind of information is welcome! We welcome all information, <br>
including scores by dormitory, timetable for Quidditch games, class information by grade, dormitory photos!<br>
Also, I will help you collect information related to muggle.<br>
We welcome exchanges in any way.<br>
