Hello, I am the person who made this homepage.
Currently, I am majoring in It at Sookmyung Women's University in Korea in 2021.
This page has the concept of a site created by Hogwarts students for Muggle Exploration class.
If you have any other ideas, we would appreciate it if you could send us your comments via email below.
And if Hogwarts students find this page, if you send me the information to modify, I will correct it as soon as I check the mail.
Any kind of information is welcome! We welcome all information, including scores by dormitory, timetable for Quidditch games, class information by grade, dormitory photos!
Also, I will help you collect information related to muggle.
We welcome exchanges in any way.
