<i> "While the bravest and the boldest
Went to daring Gryffindor."<br>
 - The Sorting Hat regarding Gryffindor traits</i><br>
The Gryffindor house emphasises the traits of courage as well as "daring, nerve, and chivalry,"
and thus its members are generally regarded as brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness. 
Some Gryffindors have also been noted to be short-tempered. 
Notably, Gryffindor house contributed many members to Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix,
although this may have been because the main members made it a point not to associate with other houses.<br><br>

<p id="master_info"><br><strong>Godric Griffindor:</strong></br>
"We'll teach all those with brave deeds to their name."
Godric Gryffindor valued courage, determination, chivalry, and strength of heart, 
and was described as one of the four most brilliant witches and wizards of his time. 
He was also the most tolerant and accepting of Muggle-borns out of the Founders, 
a point which brought about the end of his friendship with Salazar Slytherin. 
He was very forward thinking due to his creating the Sorting Hat 
to preserve the selection of the students after his time. This showcases his cleverness and creativity.
He also had a versatile mindset as he chose to wield a sword as well as a wand, 
making him a rather dynamic man who deferred to the duelling style of his opponent, muggle and wizard alike. 
Going along with this, it shows that he was respectful and fair, 
choosing to wield a sword instead of magic against muggle combatants out of a sense of fair play 
as magic would be a most decidedly unbalanced weapon in a duel against a simple sword. 
In addition to showing his sense of fairness, his deference to the duelling style of opponent also shows 
a need to challenge himself, proving his worth and courage, 
which became one of the signature traits of his House at Hogwarts.<br><br>
