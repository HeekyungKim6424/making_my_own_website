<p id="domi_info"><br>Ravenclaw: </br>
Students belonging to this house were known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest 
and rather impartial. It may be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs are not as competitive 
as the other houses, and are more modest about their accomplishments. 
Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; 
valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play 
rather than a particular aptitude in its students.
Hufflepuffs were known to have a strong moral code, and a sense of right and wrong. 
Hufflepuffs were usually accepting of everyone. 
Students in Hufflepuff were known to value everyone and treat them as equal.<br><br>

<p id="master_info"><br>Rowena Ravenclaw:</br>
Helga was renowned for her compassionate nature and charming ways. 
She took in the house-elves to work in Hogwarts Kitchen, where they could work in peace and safety. 
This was considered to be the best option at the time for house-elves. 
While the other founders were careful in selection of students, Hufflepuff took in the rest.
Helga favoured loyalty, honesty, fair play, and hard work, 
but was known to accept all students regardless of whether or not they possessed these traits. 
Members of her House usually display at least one of these traits in varying degrees.
