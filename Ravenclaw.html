<p id="domi_info">Ravenclaw: </br>
Ravenclaw House prizes learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members.</br> 
Thus, many Ravenclaws tend to be academically motivated and talented students. </br>
They also pride themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods.</br> 
It is not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types</br> 
of magic that other houses might shun. Often hard-working and diligent, </br>
as often is the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, </br>
some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be inclined</br>
to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity.</br>
Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted but even celebrated,</br>
in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities.

"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure."</br>
â€” Ravenclaw's philosophy[src]</br>
Rowena Ravenclaw (fl. c. 993) was a Scottish witch and one of the </br>
four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</br>
She was noted for her intelligence and creativity.</br>
Ravenclaw's most notable traits are her intelligence and creativity.</br>
She valued the same characteristics in her students.Rowena seemed strict and intimidating,</br>
but despite this she seemed to be forgiving and loving. </br>
This shown by the fact that she was willing to disregard her daughter's betrayal just to see</br>
her one last time on her deathbed.
