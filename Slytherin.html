Slytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. 
They also have highly developed senses of self-preservation.
This means that Slytherins tend to hesitate before acting, 
so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.
qualities which Salazar valued in the students he had chosen included 
cleverness, resourcefulness, determination, and "a certain disregard for the rules."
Slytherins tend to take charge and possess strong leadership skills. 
They are often self-assured and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal.<br><br>

<p id="master_info"><br><strong>Salazar Slytherin:</strong></br>
The qualities which Slytherin prized in his "handpicked students" 
included resourcefulness, determination, and a certain disregard for the rules, 
along with the ability to speak Parseltongue.
He also selected his students according to their cunning, ambition, and blood purity.
His House within Hogwarts was symbolised by a serpent,with House colours of green and silver.
Salazar Slytherin was known to possess great cunning and determination, 
qualities he prized in students of Slytherin House. At one point, the Sorting Hat referred 
to him as "power-hungry Slytherin". He seemed to stop at nothing to get what he wanted; 
this was proven when he constructed the Chamber of Secrets to purge Muggle-borns, 
despite the fact that the other founders disagreed with his beliefs.
