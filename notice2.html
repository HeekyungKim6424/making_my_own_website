<h3>Quidditch postponed due to corona</h3>
<p>
Due to Corona, Quidditch,<br>
which was scheduled to be held in April, has been postponed until July.
<br>There is no guarantee that it will be held in July,
<br> and it is expected that there will be some limitations.<br>
Until then, all use of the stadium is prohibited.<br>
I fully understand your disappointment, and I also regret it.<br>
Each dormitory leader would like to resume the practice using some open spaces.<br>
Thank you.<br><br>

April 2021<br>
Principal Hogwarts Minerva McGonagall.
